The basic description is added below.\\\n","However, this variation changes the evaluation process as follows:\n","1. It uses a generating Mamba model, which is run sequentially and can enter the model outputs as inputs to predict k steps ahead. The function 'generate_k_last_predictions' is added to the evaluation class for this.\n","2. The purpose of this research was to examine if predicting k steps forward provides a better distinction and leads to better classification. Thereore, we ran the process while evaluating on k= 1,2,3,4,5,10 and 20 and recorded all the results.\n","3. At the bottom of the notebook, all the results from the different k-experiments are loaded and compared. We find that k=1 generally gives the best results. Especially for the short length samples.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------\n","The general classification process is done by choosing the combination of class foreasting models that predicts the best classification score on the validation set. Here are the steps required for this:\n","1. We need to combine the **validation** sets of all classes to one big validation set used for classification evaluation.\n","2. We combine the **test** sets of all classes to one big test set used for final classification evaluation.\n","3. Define the evaluation class. This class receives a model and a set of samples for evaluation. It passes the samples through the model to receive predictions and evaluate the error of the trajectory. There are several options for the evaluation period. This period is also optimized on the validation set.\n","4. We load all the pandas dataframes that we have saved, containing all of the trained models paths and configurations. We combine to a unified dataframe.\n","5. 'get_validation_evaluation' - We want to compare the combinations of models using their errors to determine the classification. The comparison is done on the basis of a specific duration, say for a duration of 10 sec. We want to calculate the errors once and so we prepare a dictionary which saves the errors on all the 10 seconds samples from the validation set. The results are saved per model path.\n","6. 'get_best_combination' - We go through all combinations of models with one representitive per class. For each combination, we use the error of each model per sample to classify it. We obtain all the predictions and calculate the classification scores using the labels. We save the combination with the best f1-score for the UAV class.\n","7. Execute optimization for the best evaluation period for the chosen sample length to optimize. In the report we show different optimizations for 5 second samples vs. 30 second samples.\n","8. Using the best combination, do:\\\n","  a. Final evaluation of errors for the class forecasting models on the test set. This is done for all sample durations.\\\n","  b. Final classification using the errors of each class model.\\\n","  c. Calculate performance (precision, recall, F1-score), using the class labels.\\\n","  d. Show the metrics and confusion matrix for each duration.\\\n","  e. Show bar plot with values"],"metadata":{"id":"G0hVUWj0SKz3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###Imports"],"metadata":{"id":"SREapPYWURYf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install
